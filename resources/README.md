# Resources

This folder holds project assets that are not part of the built app:

- `screenshots/`: images used in the README (app view, print preview, etc.).
- `branding/`: logos or brand guidelines related to the project.

Add files here and reference them from the root README using relative paths, e.g.:

`![App view](./resources/screenshots/app-view.png)`
